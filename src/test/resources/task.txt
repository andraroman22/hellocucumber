One of the question would be if we have any other conditions to login into the application. For example captcha code
Another one is regarding what is the format of the username/password(uppercase/lowercase letters,special characters,etc)


Feature: As a user, I want to be able to log into the application.

Scenario: User is able to login into the application
  Given user has account
  When I put good login and password
  Then I should login to platform

  Scenario: User is  not able to login into the application
    Given user has account
    When I put bad login and good password
    Then I shouldn't login to platform

  Scenario: User is  not able to login into the application
    Given user has account
    When I put good login and bad password
    Then I shouldn't login to platform

  Scenario: User is  not able to login into the application
    Given user has account
    When I put bad login and bad password
    Then I shouldn't login to platform
